# Software implementation

This subdirectory includes all the scripts necessary to replicate the implementation presented in the paper. Two main files are responsible for operating the platform: main.py (python) and arduino_main.ino (arduino). The rest of the files constitute the dependencies necessary to run main.py: including the plotter construction, the tracking algorithming and streaming of data, and the actuation protocol.
